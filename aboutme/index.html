    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Eli Barker and I am from Arvada, Colorado. I absolutely love all things outdoors including hiking,
        swimming and rock climbing! I hope to move back to Colorado once I graduate so that I can continue to experience the beautiful
        nature and scenery that the Rockies bring!</p>
    <p>This is my 5th semester here at BYU-I and I am studying accounting with a minor in computer programming!
        I am hoping to get a job as an auditor and eventually become a CFO of a company.</p>
    <p>I am the youngest in my family with 3 siblings. My family lives all over the country
        and both of my sisters are married and have children.</p>
