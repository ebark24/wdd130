          tax page or the auditing page they can have their questions answered about the types of services that we provide
          and what  working with our company will look like.

          The main page will have our values and help to show that we are different from our competitors. It will have a
           header with the logo and well as tabs for the other parts of the website. As customers scroll down they will see
          our mission statement and a little things about why we value our customers. It will show some pictures relating to
